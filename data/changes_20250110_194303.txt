Okay, let's break down the changes in student grades between the two JSON files you provided.

**General Observations**

*   The data covers multiple courses: Accelerated Math, English, PE, Reading, Science, and Social Studies.
*   Each course is broken down by periods (e.g., 2024-2025 T1, 2024-2025 T2).
*   Within each period, grades are categorized, and each category has a list of assignments.

**1. New Assignments Added**

To determine new assignments, we will check for assignments in the current grades that are not present in the previous grades.

**Accelerated Math 6/7A: Section 18:**
    *   **No new assignments** have been added in either T1 or T2

**English 6: Section 1:**

*   No changes in assignment grades in either T1 or T2.

**English 6: Section 1:**
*   No changes in assignment grades in either T1 or T2.
